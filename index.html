                <p>
                    ~Hi I'm Samantha, but you can call me Sammy! 
                    I'm a semi-experienced programmer who is forcing herself to learn more everyday about frontend development, backend development, networking and other programming areas.
                    I have some experience constructing neural networks, math oriented programs and developing games using <a href= "https://unity.com"> Unity </a> and <a href= "https://roblox.com"> Roblox </a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned to code primarily through Java, but I have been able to switch easily back and forth to Java, Python, and JavaScript.
                    Currently I provide customer service for <a href= "https://rbx.place"> my website </a> through <a href= "https://discord.com"> Discord </a> 
                    (I wouldn't recommend actually joining the website's Discord as the community is quite toxic, but thats what you get when you have hundreds of teenagers buying and selling things.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    My site is a selling platform where Roblox users can sell their limited items using an automated process that sends trades when the seller recieves payment through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/"> PayPal </a> and/or <a href="https://stripe.com/"> Stripe</a>.  
                    While the website may look impressive for someone who has little experience in web development,
                    I dont actually do any of the front end development myself, but I am working on learning web development so that hopefully I can someday!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not currently looking for a Job as I am a full time student but any project reccomendations or resources would be greatly appreciated! ãƒ„
                </p>
